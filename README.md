🐍 Python Beginner Projects

This repository contains a collection of beginner-level Python projects designed to strengthen your understanding of core programming concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, file I/O, and working with libraries.

📁 Project List
1️⃣ Number Guessing Game

A simple console game where the computer picks a random number and you try to guess it.
Concepts: loops, conditionals, random module, user input.
Run:

python number_guessing_game.py

2️⃣ To-Do List (CLI)

A command-line app to manage daily tasks — add, view, mark as done, or delete tasks.
Tasks are stored in a tasks.json file so they persist even after closing the app.
Concepts: lists, dictionaries, JSON, file handling, CLI commands.
Run:

python to_do_list.py

3️⃣ Simple Calculator

Performs basic arithmetic operations (+, −, ×, ÷) between two numbers.
Includes error handling for invalid inputs and zero division.
Concepts: functions, loops, try/except, user input.
Run:

python simple_calculator.py

4️⃣ Password Generator

Generates strong, random passwords based on user preferences — length, uppercase, numbers, and symbols.
Concepts: random module, string module, loops, conditionals.
Run:

python password_generator.py

5️⃣ Basic Quiz App

An interactive multiple-choice quiz that tracks your score and gives feedback on each question.
Concepts: lists, dictionaries, loops, user input, conditionals.
Run:

python basic_quiz_app.py

🧠 Key Learnings

Core Python syntax and logic building.

Handling user input safely.

File I/O using JSON.
